1. Clone this repository. Development happens on the `gatsby-dev` branch.
2. Run `npm install` to install dev packages.
3. Run `gatsby develop` to start the Gatsby dev environment.
4. Do stuff!
5. To deploy to GitHub pages, run `npm run deploy:github`. This will run `gatsby build`
and push the `static` directory to the `master` branch` on GitHub.
6. Purge caches on Cloudflare (@todo automate this).
